- Controlling devices via web services using Flask involves creating an API (Application Programming Interface) with Flask endpoints that handle requests to control the devices. 

- Send Requests to Control Devices: To control devices via web services, send HTTP requests to the Flask endpoints from your client applications or scripts. You can use libraries like requests in Python.

- Internet of Things (IoT) devices equipped with networking capabilities can act as clients to a Flask server. These devices can send sensor data, receive commands, and interact with the Flask application using HTTP requests.
